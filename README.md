Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

## The goal

You've been hired by the World Bank. They've got a lot of data to analyze - that's where you come in.

At first you'll access information from world_bank_data.wdi_country. But that has its limitations, as do your permissions. Upload a .env file with the credentials for your own database, and then you can copy - and filter - information to get your own table of countries.

Using SQL, you'll have to write some queries that will automatically process allll that data. Use joins, subqueries, and order bys to categorize and find any important statistics. 

Remember to double check your code output!
